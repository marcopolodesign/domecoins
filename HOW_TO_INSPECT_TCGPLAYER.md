# How to Inspect TCGPlayer and Build Your Scraper

## Step 1: Inspect TCGPlayer in Browser

### Open TCGPlayer and Search
1. Go to: https://www.tcgplayer.com/
2. Search for: "Charizard Pokemon"
3. Open DevTools (Cmd+Option+I or F12)
4. Go to **Network** tab
5. Filter by: **Fetch/XHR**

### What to Look For

While searching, you'll see requests like:
- `search-api.tcgplayer.com` 
- API endpoints with tokens
- GraphQL queries
- JSON responses with card data

### Document These Details:

1. **Request URL**: Copy the full URL
2. **Request Method**: POST or GET?
3. **Headers**: Look for authorization/tokens
4. **Payload**: What data is being sent?
5. **Response**: Structure of the card data

## Step 2: Test the Endpoint

Once you find the endpoint, test it:

```bash
# Example (you'll need to fill in real values):
curl 'https://mp-search-api.tcgplayer.com/v1/search/request' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' \
  --data-raw '{
    "q": "charizard",
    "filters": {
      "productLine": ["Pokemon"]
    }
  }'
```

## Step 3: Share Your Findings

Please share with me:
1. Screenshot of Network tab showing the requests
2. Or copy-paste:
   - The request URL
   - Request headers  
   - Request payload
   - Sample response (first few cards)

## Alternative: Use GitHub Data

Since the official [pokemon-tcg-data](https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-data) repository has ALL card data as JSON files, we can:

1. **Download card data from GitHub** (no API blocking!)
2. **Scrape TCGPlayer for prices only**
3. **Combine both sources**

This is likely the BEST approach because:
- ✅ GitHub has complete card info (images, stats, sets)
- ✅ No rate limiting on GitHub
- ✅ We only need prices from TCGPlayer
- ✅ Much simpler than full scraping

Would you like me to implement this hybrid approach?
